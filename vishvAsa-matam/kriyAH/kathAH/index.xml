one first hand tale someone I know did not beget children given his secular outlook he went to doctors and specialists upon all the tests &amp;amp; wait for 4 yrs was told it&amp;rsquo;s unexplained infertality nothing can be done hence recommended IUI/ IVF.
however he had learned rudra as child. so was recommended to do rudra abhisheka starting with sadyojata to Ishana mantras. because of his ego he made a challenge with me &amp;amp; others that he will do this for 48 days &amp;amp; only if get pregnant within 3 months will ascribe this to these actions other wise coincidence.</description>

My relative was childless for 12 years. A mantravid from chera regions prepared an oshadhi for them. The couple observed a vrata to santānagopālaka, performed the japa as per instructions, finishing with homa. They had a child shortly. I learned vidyāgopālaka mantras from him.</description>

There was this vaidika and a vidvān. He had a set of students learning śruti from him. All of a sudden, one of his student went incommunicado. The vaidika paid him a visit. It turned out the student developed white kuṣṭha and became depressed. Medications weren&amp;rsquo;t working.. It was so worse that he quit his job and rarely came out of his room. The student asked &amp;ldquo;Guruji, you often say śruti has solutions for laukika problems.</description>
