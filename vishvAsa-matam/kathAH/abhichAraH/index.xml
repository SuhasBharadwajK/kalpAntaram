A friend once contacted us regarding a problem his friend was facing. The problem was an acute abhichāra that was on-going. The guy already had close brush with death twice in that week. He was so shaken up that he practically locked himself in that room.
His vaiṣṇava guru was traveling and uncontactable. He should have listened to his guru and performed the puraścharaṇa of +++(hayagrIva)+++ mantras given to him a year back.</description>
